### 細かい箇条書き

1.`import { ReactComponent as SoftwareLogo } from "assets/software-logo.svg";`

- import SVGs directly as React components.
- 参考链接：[Adding Images, Fonts, and Files | Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/)
- This is a new special syntax when importing SVG in React. The ReactComponent import name is special and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename.
